I wanted to watermark few sunset images taken by me, before posting it internet. After searching for an hour or so, coudn't find any freeware tool, all are shareware, means you have buy, #$#$!@##!#@#@. Decided to make on my own, many thanks to Joel Neubeck article in codeproject(http://www.codeproject.com). Using his article, just tried to create a proper user friendly GUI tool to mark images with copyright note, also optionally with your company logo.
